# Arithm
A basic arithmetic function parser GUI based on Arash Partow's *exprtk*. If you're not fond of the usual OS calculators for your daily routine, this application can be used for calculations of arithmetic expressions. It can also plot functions.

# Usage

Apart from entering arithmetic expressions, the plot interval *\[a, b\]* can be set during runtime or it can be defined via *Arithm.ini*. The variable *x* is reserved for evaluating the expressions for plotting.

The user functions *f*, *g* and *h* can be explicitly defined. Please note that no plot will be displayed if neither user functions nor variable *x* is used. In this case, only a constant result value is displayed (calculator function).

# Syntax
